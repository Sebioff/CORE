CORE, the PHP Framework

This is a framework designed for creating PHP websites in an object-oriented way. Its main features are:

* organization of your website into sub-sites ("Modules") for a clean code structure
* elaborate handling of formulars
* separation of code and content
* a pretty sweet database access layer

You might also want to check out [Rakuun](https://github.com/Sebioff/Rakuun) as an example of a big project that uses this framework since many years.

Requirements
------------
* Extensions: mbstring, gd, mysql (additionally for the development environment: tidy)
